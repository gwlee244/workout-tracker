# Unit 17 NoSQL: Workout Tracker

## Description

For this assignment, you'll create a workout tracker. You have already been provided with the front end code in the Develop folder. This assignment will require you to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Business Context

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout, or continue with their last workout.
The user should be able to:

Add exercises to a previous workout plan.

Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

View multiple the combined weight of multiple exercises on the stats page.
